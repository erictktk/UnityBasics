### PitchModulator.cs
Continuously modulates the pitch of an AudioSource using an AnimationCurve. - Ensures the AudioSource is playing and looping on Start. - Uses cycleDuration to determine the time span of one curve cycle. - Applies pitch offset scaled by the given factor.

### PlaceAtMouseDirection.cs
Positions a GameObject in the direction of the mouse from a given origin. - Converts screen mouse position to world space using a camera. - Limits placement distance to a maximum radius from the origin. - Defaults origin to self and camera to Camera.main if not assigned.

### PlaceOnMouse.cs
Moves a GameObject to the mouse position in world space. - Converts screen coordinates to world using the assigned camera (defaults to Camera.main). - Keeps correct depth by using the distance between camera and object.
